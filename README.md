# R-Central-Tendency-Project

In this Project i used R programming language, from the Rstudio to evaluate the mean, median and mode of 3 housing projects in New York City. Given the mean, median and mode of all 3 projects, the result shows that Queens Borough has the cheapest rent, while Brooklyn Borough has the most expensive rent in the New York neighbourhood.
